// In synchronous system the tasks are executed in sequence i.e.after
// one task other task will be executed
// In Async, if one task has started executing, in mean time other task
// can get executed
// Thus Asyn is better than Sync

// In synchronous system we always use call back function.
// A call back function is called after the execution of the task
// It also takes arguement error which is used to tell the error in the execution of task
